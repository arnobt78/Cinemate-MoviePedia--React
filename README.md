## Project Summary

Cinemate MoviePedia is a full-fledged React web application built for discovering, exploring, and learning about movies using The Movie Database (TMDB) API. This project leverages modern React practices, component-level state management, TailwindCSS for styling, and Flowbite for UI components. It is designed as a practical, real-world example of how to build a dynamic, API-driven SPA (Single Page Application) with React, and is ideal for both learning and teaching purposes.

## Scripts and Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

---

---

## Routing and Components

The application uses React Router to handle navigation between pages:

Example (in `App.js`):

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/movie/:id" element={<MovieDetails />} />
        {/* Add more routes as needed */}
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

---

### Example Components

**MovieCard.js**
```jsx
function MovieCard({ movie }) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white shadow rounded p-4">
      <img src={`https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/${movie.poster_path}`} alt={movie.title} />
      <h3 className="mt-2 font-bold">{movie.title}</h3>
      <p>Rating: {movie.vote_average}</p>
      {/* Link to details, genres, etc. */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
---

**API Fetch Example (api/tmdb.js)**
```js
const API_KEY = process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY;
const BASE_URL = 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3';

export async function fetchTrendingMovies() {
  const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/trending/movie/week?api_key=${API_KEY}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.results;
}
```
---

## Learning and Examples

- **Component-based development:** Learn to break down your UI into modular, testable components.
- **API integration with Fetch/Axios:** Understand how to request and process external API data.
- **SPA Routing:** Seamless navigation between movie lists and individual movie detail pages.
- **Environment variables:** Securely manage sensitive keys.
- **TailwindCSS & Flowbite:** Rapidly build and style modern UIs.
- **Deployment:** Example config for Netlify deployment with `netlify.toml`.
